			<p>Hey Miss June, I was thinking "申辦電子帳單及電子權益手冊，享電子帳單使用期間免年費優惠", but I am not sure is the 5% still there if you choose electrical bill. Maybe you need to make sure this point!! BTW, 朱俐靜 just sings 3 songs in our restaurant today!! >///<  Updated 12:47 February 17, 2016</p>
			<p>Yo little June, do you think to plan the trip on the long weekend is a good idea or normal weekend is fine? The 4 days vacation is just after our Malasia trip...that's my concern-.-. Updated 15:10 February 16, 2016</p>
			<p>June baby, please watch out this idiot because he likes to play around girls. That's why I don't want you go get involved...BTW, I will be late today>_<. Updated 19:50 February 15, 2016</p>
			<p>Maybe it's because he has me as a mutual friend, so you like to add him as friend first or you want to let him add your friend? I think you can just cancel the application. Updated 13:30 February 15, 2016</p>
			<p>I think you can consider to apply other credit card based on your requirement(Ex: Higher cash back) The idiot block the ppl who is not his friend, so maybe we should let the idiot add your friends FB. Updated 13:19 February 15, 2016</p>
			<p>I already applied for my new credit card (1.2% cash back domestic, 2.2% cash back international). I might receive the new card after 2~3 weeks. Note: 元大銀行 鑽金卡  Updated 15:19 February 4, 2016</p>

			<p>BB June, my money is your money. You money is your money. That means you get 11,000 for year end bonus >_<. For ANZ credit card, after you spend 5000, the cash back will back to 0.5%. You can check the credit card info in there website.  Updated 15:33 January 29, 2016</p>
